# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
This project analyzes PyBer App performance based on the type of city. The project takes a look into the rides, drivers, and fare information grouped by the city type then analyzes the fare info weekly from Janurary 2019 to April 2019.

## Results
Based on the analysis, one can tell that the PyBer App has been most successful in Urban city types. Urban cities had a total of 1,625 rides in 2019, which is significantly more than rural (125) and suburban (625) cities combined. However, on average, urban cities had a lower average fare per ride ($24.53) compared to rural ($32.62) and suburban ($30.97) cities. This makes sense assuming that urban cities have destinations close to one another. \

Furthermore, the analysis show that the between the January and April month, rural areas have the highest amount of business around April. Suburban cities have the highest amount of business in January and February while urban cities have fairly good business throughout the year excpet for the first week of January, which can be assumed to be affected by the holidays. Overall, all cities seen to perform well at the end of Febrary. \

##Summary
Based on the results, the following recommendations can be made: 
- Decrease the fare rate in rural and suburban areas to increase business and make using PyBer more attractive and affordable 
- Increase fate rates in urban areas since there is more business, especially during busy season (mid February to April) 
- Research additional benefitis for rural and suburban drivers to increase drivers available for potential customers
